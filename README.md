# Deep learning in order book markets: the impact of market frictions on return predictability
Repository dedicated to contain the code used for the master thesis: "Deep learning in order book markets: the impact of market frictions on return predictability", by Mauricio Pereira da Silva Filho, as part of the requirements for the Msc. in Machine Learning and Data Science at Imperial College London.

The repository contains code used to:

- Prepare orderbook and message files downloaded from the LOBSTER website for further processing;
- Generate multiple types of returns;
- Train, validate and test the deep learning models: deepLOB, deepOF, deepVOL and DTNN;
- Analyze the results;

This repository takes large portions of the code of the papers:
